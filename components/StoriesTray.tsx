I really miss a consistent user experience. A core idea that I as a user can rely on to predict how a new app will work. I was in awe when I discovered as a kid that user interface were a research area. Things like Fitt's Law and so on. It was not just opinion.
Today I get the feeling it's mostly just opinion. Either the designer's opinion or the wish to copy the look of something.

Whenever I see a hamburger menu I silently think "Here someone has given up".

And there are a lot of behaviors that are not functioning well.
